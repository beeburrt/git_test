# ~~git_test~~ 
My original, numero uno, very first ever repo has been repurposed 
# :recycle:
I mean, it was just sitting there

So now this is my:
# Landing Page 
assignment for [**The Odin Project**](https://theodinproject.com) and also for my ongoing Git-learning

So far, I haven't learned CSS grid yet.

So this page was made strictly using flexbox. I think it turned out pretty awesome.

(p.s. I had to google how to use the @media rule and the lil JavaScript function)
